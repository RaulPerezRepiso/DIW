00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
The serve in table tennis is governed by strict rules to ensure fair plane conditions.

00:05.840 --> 00:10.960
In this video you'll discover all the requirements for a legal serve that meets the official regulations.

00:16.560 --> 00:20.160
The serve must begin with the ball resting on the open palm of the hand.

00:20.880 --> 00:25.840
Holding it with a closed hand is not allowed, and placing it on the fingers could also be considered

00:25.840 --> 00:31.520
an infringement. The ball must remain behind the end line and above the surface of the table.

00:32.480 --> 00:37.200
You can serve from any position as long as the ball stays outside this area from the toss until

00:37.200 --> 00:42.640
it is hit. If during the serve the ball moves in front of the end line, or is hidden below the

00:42.640 --> 00:49.200
table surface, it will be considered a fault. The ball must be tossed vertically, without adding

00:49.200 --> 00:56.000
any intentional spin, and must reach a minimum height of 16 cm. While a perfectly perpendicular

00:56.000 --> 01:01.440
toss is not required, excessive deviation may be considered a fault, depending on the umpire's

01:01.440 --> 01:08.160
interpretation. Once the ball has been tossed, the serve is considered initiated, and if you fail to

01:08.160 --> 01:14.080
hit it or stop your movement, it will be counted as a failed serve. In table tennis there is no second

01:14.080 --> 01:18.080
serve opportunity as in other sports, so you will automatically lose the point.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.960
The ball must be hit during its descent. Hitting it while it is still rising or when it is

01:24.960 --> 01:30.640
exactly at its highest point is not allowed. The visibility of the ball during the serve is another

01:30.640 --> 01:36.800
crucial aspect. From the moment the ball is tossed until it is hit, it must remain fully visible to

01:36.800 --> 01:42.800
the opponent at all times. It is not allowed to hide it with the arm, head, or any part of the body.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.160
If at any point the ball goes out of the opponent's line of sight, the serve will be considered and

01:48.160 --> 01:54.240
valid. Once the ball is hit, it must first bounce on your side of the table and then on your

01:54.240 --> 02:00.000
opponent's side. If during this process, the ball touches the net but still lands correctly on the

02:00.000 --> 02:05.360
opponent's side, the serve is considered a let and must be replayed. There is no limit to the

02:05.360 --> 02:11.680
number of times a serve can be repeated in the case of a let. In singles matches, you can serve to

02:11.680 --> 02:17.600
any area of the table. However, in doubles matches, the serve must be performed diagonally,

02:17.600 --> 02:23.680
from the server's right hand side to the receiver's right hand side. The umpire has the authority to

02:23.680 --> 02:28.960
determine whether a serve is valid or not. Depending on the severity of the infringement,

02:28.960 --> 02:36.880
the umpire may issue a warning or directly award the point to the opponent.
